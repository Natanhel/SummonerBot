Introduction:
============
SummonerBot is an Android bot for people who had it enough with the farming required in SW.
Please use with caution since botting is AGAINST the company policy and YOU CAN GET BANNED for using this bot!
Nonetheless, the bot uses ADB and uses your phone functionality so it may look like a user feedback and not a 3rd side program.
Apple phones will not be supported.

insall python and use in command line:
  cd /path/to/SummonerBot/
  python ./sbot.py -f

WiFI Support:
=============
In order to use the bot over WiFi you'll need to connect the phone to the USB port,
write in the command line the next (unix) command:

adb tcpip 5555 & ip="`adb shell ip -f inet addr show wlan0 | grep -oP "\d{3}.\d{3}.\d.\d" | grep -m1 ""`" & adb connect ${ip}:5555

This will establish a connection to the phone created by the phone's own IP address
and link the adb over the correct IP in your router.
